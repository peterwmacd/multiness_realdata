# multiness_realdata
Real data analysis for MULTIplex NEtworks with Shared Structure

All code is contained in "realdata_trade.R", based on data loaded as part of the development R package "multiness". It will produce results and plots matching those in the pre-print "Latent space models for multiplex networks with shared structure" [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14409).
